## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.
3. Follow the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to understand the pipeline.
4. Modify the modules in the `src/` folder to customize the pipeline.

## Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Located in `src/preprocess.py`. This module includes:
- Functions for data cleaning, missing value handling, and feature scaling.
- Splitting datasets into training and testing sets.

### 2. Model Training
Located in `src/model.py`. This module includes:
- Definitions for different machine learning models.
- Training and testing pipelines.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
Located in `src/evaluate.py`. This module includes:
- Functions for calculating performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization tools for confusion matrices and learning curves.

### 4. Utilities
Located in `src/helpers.py`. This module includes:
- Helper functions for logging, model saving/loading, and miscellaneous utilities.

## Contributing
Trainees are encouraged to:
- Extend modules by adding new functionalities.
- Experiment with different datasets and models.
- Write unit tests for their additions in the `tests/` folder.
